    <h1>CYBERINTEL</h1>
    <p>We’re on a mission to rewrite the security narrative in India — making the digital world safer by uncovering threats before they strike. Silent, precise, and ethical — we notify, not exploit.</p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>CYBERINTEL is a cybersecurity-driven initiative that actively investigates hidden threat surfaces across the dark web, black-market forums, stealer logs, Telegram groups, and other unregulated environments. Our mission is to locate critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and bring them to the attention of affected entities before they are exploited by malicious actors. Our services are completely free and provided in the spirit of ethical responsibility and cyber defense.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While our domain may be new, our work is Not. Our core team has been privately operating in the infosec community, assisting in multiple real-world incidents involving leaked infrastructure. The launch of CYBERINTEL was driven by the need to organize this effort under a unified name and provide transparency around our disclosures. Our intent is purely protective, with no commercial interest or expectation — only a commitment to digital security.</p>
